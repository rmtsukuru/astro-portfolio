                <h2>What is Astrology?</h2>
                <p>Astrology is an ancient practice of divination made famous by the Greco-Roman civilizations of antiquity, but found in many times and places all over the world. With an etymology of words meaning "the study of the stars" and a history that overlaps with that of astronomy, alchemy, and various occult and other spiritual practices, astrology is a tradition with deep roots.</p>
                <p>The central premise of astrology is that what happens in the sky affects our affairs here on the earth. In particular, the position of different planetary bodies in the sky at the time of your birth, or your <em>natal chart</em> is said to influence the type of person you are and the sort of life you will lead, based on the associations of each of those <em>planets</em> and the astrological <em>signs</em> they fall under.</p>

                <h2>The Twelve Signs</h2>
                <p>Within traditional Western astrology using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_and_tropical_astrology" target="_blank">tropical zodiac</a>, the sky is divided up into twelve equal quadrants, each of which is named after a constellation within that quadrant. These are the signs we are talking about when astrologers and astrology fans say things like "What's your sign?" or "My sun sign is in Aquarius." Here are the signs as follows:</p>

                <h2>Planets in Astrology</h2>
                <p>Each of the planets in our solar system (and some other planetary bodies both within and beyond it) is considered to have a particular meaning or responsibility associated with it within astrology. The most important planets, known as the <strong>Big Three</strong> within the community, are the <span class="sun">Sun</span>, <span class="moon">Moon</span>, and <span class="ascendent">Rising Sign</span> (or Ascendant), but all of the inner planets of the solar system exert important influences and are commonly considered when looking at the natal chart.</p>
                <p>So while your Sun Sign could be in Libra (and therefore you are, or consider yourself to be, "a Libra"), the other planets in your natal chart will be in different signs, and so you will have aspects of all of those different planets in your chart too in addition to the Libra Sun energy, and all of those different influences will combine to make up the unique combination that is you! So it's inaccurate to say that "all Geminis" are the same, or something similar; even if someone is a Gemini Sun, that will be expressed very differently if they have a Cancer Moon vs. a Capricorn Moon.</p>
